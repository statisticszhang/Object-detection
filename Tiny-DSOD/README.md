# Tiny-DSOD: Lightweight Object Detection for Resource Restricted Usage

This repository releases the code for our paper

**Tiny-DSOD: Lightweight Object Detection for Resource Restricted Usage (BMVC2018)**

**Yuxi Li, [Jianguo Li](https://sites.google.com/site/leeplus/), Jiuwei Li and Weiyao Lin**

The code is based on the [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [DSOD](https://github.com/szq0214/DSOD) framework.

## Introduction

Tiny-DSOD tries to tackle the trade-off between detection accuracy and computation resource consumption. In this work, our tiny-model outperforms other small sized detection network (pelee, mobilenet-ssd or tiny-yolo) in the metrics of FLOPs, parameter size and accuracy. To be specific, on the dataset of PASCAL VOC2007, Tiny-DSOD achieves mAP of 72.1% with less than 1 million parameters (0.95M)

## Preparation

1. Install dependencies our caffe framework needs. You can visit the [caffe official website](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) and follow the instructions there to install the dependent libraries and drivers correctly.

2. Clone this repository and compile the code
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/lyxok1/Tiny-DSOD.git

cd Tiny-DSOD
# visit the Makefile then modify the compile options and path to your library there
make -j8
```

3. Prepare corresponding dataset (if need training). Please see the document in [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) detail 

## Train a model from scratch

Suppose the code is runing under the main directory of caffe.

First generate the model prototxt files
```Shell
python examples/DCOD/DCOD_pascal.py  # for voc training

python examples/DCOD/DCOD_kitti.py # for kitti training

python examples/DCOD/DCOD_coco.py # for coco training
```

And then use the binary `./build/tools/caffe` to train the generated network
```Shell
./jobs/DCOD300/${DATASET}/DCOD300_300x300/DCOD300_${DATASET}_DCOD300_300x300.sh
# Alternatively, you can directly use the binary to train in command line

./build/tools/caffe train -solver models/DCOD300/$DATASET/DCOD300_300x300/solver.prototxt -gpu all 2>&1 | tee models/DCOD300/$DATASET/DCOD300_300x300/train.log

```

## Deploy a pre-trained model

If you want to directly deploy a pre-trained model, you can use the demo scripts we provide in the `example/DCOD/` directory

- for image input detection, use the following command:
```Shell
python examples/DCOD/image_detection_demo.py <option>

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -model MODEL          path to model prototxt file
  -weights WEIGHTS      path to weight file
  -img_dir IMG_DIR      path to input image
  -num NUM              number of images for detection
  -gpu                  specifiy using GPU or not
  -threshold THRESHOLD  threshold to filter bbox with low confidence
```

- for video input detection, use the following command:
```Shell
python examples/DCOD/video_detection_demo.py <option>

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -model MODEL          path to model prototxt file
  -weights WEIGHTS      path to weight file
  -video VIDEO          path to input video
  -gpu                  specifiy using GPU or not
  -threshold THRESHOLD  threshold to filter bbox with low confidence
```
